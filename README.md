The Pac-Man Dossier was written by Jamey Pittman more than a decade ago. It was originally hosted on his Comcast webspace, but was taken down sometime in 2015. I've restored it here for archival purposes.

Changes:

- Beautified HTML.
- Removed PayPal donation links - they were broken anyway.
- Changed all links to HTTPS.
- Restructed media hierarchy.
